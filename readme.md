### **CalorieCountingApp: Calorie Tracking and food recomendation app**
**CalorieCountingApp** is an Android application built with **Java**, **XML**, and **SQLite** that keeps track of all the calories that you ate today and tells you how much more you need to eat to gain muscle, lose fat and maintain your weight. It also gives you food recomendations based on what you have eaten so far in the day based on your macronutrient calories so you can have a balanced diet
For exaple if I ate an abundance of steak earlier, it would recomend I eat carbs like bread, rice or pasta for my next meal to get to my calorie goal in a sustainable manner
**This app allows the user to easily check thier calories and let them know what type of food they should need next to maximize their fitness goals**
